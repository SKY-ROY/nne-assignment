<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Launch 2 separate builds either by launching one on Unity Editor and the other executable or 2 executables separately.</li>
  <li>Press the "Host" button to launch the app as a host(client and server being the same device).</li>
  <li>Press the "Client" button on the other build to launch the app as a client only and join the locally hosted server, No need to enter any port and addresses as Unity will internally manage the localhost port for both clients.</li>
  <li>After both the clients join the same room, their avatars will be visible in the scene.</li>
  <li>Use the "W-A-S-D" or "Arrow" keys to move the player, and use the mouse to look around and aim the crosshair on the screen.</li>
  <li>Once you encounter a QR Code object stuck to the wall, press LMB(Left Mouse button) while aiming the crosshair towards it. This will align the DataCube in its respective orientation such that the corresponding QR Code child object of the cube overlaps the QR Code on the wall.</li>
  <li>Now you can repeat the above step of aiming and pressing the LMB, for Data Objects attached to the Data Cube. The respective Cube's color-based data will be reflected over the UI on the screen.</li>
  <li>Close either of the clients to stop the session hosted or disconnect from the room, based on which client is leaving respectively.</li>
</ol>
